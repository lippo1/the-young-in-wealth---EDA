# the-young-in-wealth---EDA
My first EDA commit on GitHub

Last year, I made an EDA on the same dataset, but that notebook was very bad, because I was a true beginner with 1-2 months into the Data Science world. At the moment, I have almost 1 year since I started ( been learning other things as well and dealing with personal stuff, and I'm still not 100% focused).
The purpose of this project was to learn and put into practice the storytelling used in many notebooks and to extract as many informations I can)

You can see the code and dataset on kaggle:
